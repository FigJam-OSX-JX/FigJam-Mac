## Brief

FigJam delivers professional collaborative <a href="#">online whiteboard</a> through native application architecture optimized for macOS environments. The software operates efficiently on both Intel and Apple Silicon processors through universal binary compilation, ensuring optimal performance regardless of hardware generation while maintaining consistent feature availability across all processor architectures.

Deep system integration enables FigJam to leverage macOS capabilities including Quick Look previews for supported file formats, Spotlight indexing enabling system-wide search of application content, and Services menu integration providing functionality accessible from other applications. The application handles multi-display configurations intelligently, remembering window positions and adapting interface layouts appropriate for each connected monitor resolution.

Customization capabilities provide extensive control over interface appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and workflow preferences without overwhelming new users. Essential settings remain immediately accessible through organized preference panels, while advanced options reveal themselves contextually when relevant to specific operations requiring detailed configuration. Professional workflows benefit from scriptable automation supporting both AppleScript and command-line interfaces.

Performance optimization through background processing maintains interface responsiveness during intensive operations, preventing user interaction blocking that would disrupt workflow continuity. Efficient memory management and intelligent caching strategies balance resource consumption against operational requirements, supporting extended usage sessions without performance degradation or system resource exhaustion.
